## Why NOT Other Colors?

### Colors NOT Included & Reasons:

1. **Bright Neons/Fluorescents**
   - **Reason**: Not suitable for interior latex paint
   - **Use Case**: Better for specialty/industrial coatings
   - **Professional Standard**: Avoided in premium interior lines

2. **Ultra-Deep Blacks (beyond Earth Black)**
   - **Reason**: Difficult to achieve with low-VOC formulations
   - **Technical Limitation**: May require higher VOC content
   - **Current Offering**: Earth Black (#1B1B1B) is the deepest safe option

3. **Metallic/Pearlescent Shades**
   - **Reason**: Requires different base formulation
   - **Product Line**: Reserved for specialty finishes
   - **Current Scope**: Standard latex emulsion only

4. **Pure Saturated Colors (100% saturation)**
   - **Reason**: Too bold for interior walls, limited market
   - **Professional Feedback**: Designers prefer muted, sophisticated tones
   - **Trend Analysis**: High saturation colors have low adoption rates

5. **More RAL Colors (442 total exist)**
   - **Reason**: RAL system is for industrial use
   - **Current Database**: RAL colors replaced with designer shades
   - **Strategy**: Focus on named, designer-curated palette vs industrial codes
