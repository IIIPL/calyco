Beach villas in Goa thrive on bold colours that echo sunsets and tropical foliage. The challenge is preserving those hues against UV exposure, salty air, and frequent cleaning cycles. This palette guide references the [Goa region page](/regions/eco-friendly-exterior-paints-goa), durability insights from the [Exterior pillar](/exterior-paint), and low-VOC wellness cues from the [Eco-Friendly pillar](/eco-friendly-paint). We also integrate learnings from the [Kerala colour trends blog](/blog/kerala/top-colours-kerala-2025) and [Delhi palette guide](/blog/delhi/eco-colours-delhi-apartments) for cross-country inspiration.
