Kerala’s lush environment inspires homeowners to choose palettes that reflect backwaters, hills, and heritage architecture. In 2025, eco-friendly paints dominate thanks to their low VOC emissions and resistance to monsoon-induced dampness. This trend report combines climate lessons from the [Kerala region guide](/regions/exterior-eco-paints-kerala-monsoon), wellness cues from the [Eco-Friendly pillar](/eco-friendly-paint), and interior styling guidance from the [Interior pillar](/interior-paint). We also cross-link to Delhi and Goa blogs for pan-India inspiration.
