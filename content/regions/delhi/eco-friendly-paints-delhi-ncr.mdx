## Climate Challenges Across Delhi NCR

Delhi NCR balances dry winters, dusty summers, and a short but intense monsoon. Construction dust and vehicular pollution coat balconies daily, while smog episodes trap pollutants indoors. Apartments often share walls with service shafts, causing damp patches during July-August rains. Families juggling work-from-home setups need odour-free repainting that does not interrupt routines. In this complex climate, low-VOC and washable systems become essential, not optional. Calyco paints address these challenges by combining low emissions with anti-soiling additives tested for North Indian dust load.

Poor air quality also accelerates wall yellowing and exacerbates respiratory sensitivities. Many residents close windows during smog, locking in volatile organic compounds from conventional paints. Calyco’s eco formulations mitigate this issue by keeping VOC levels under 30 g/L, ensuring indoor air stays fresher even when ventilation is limited. The [Eco-Friendly & Low-VOC pillar](/eco-friendly-paint) dives deeper into these health benefits, while the [Interior Paints pillar](/interior-paint) explains how washability supports everyday cleaning rituals.

## Calyco Solutions for Apartments and Villas

2. **SilkGuard Satin for Living Areas**: Combines stain resistance with a subtle sheen that uplifts natural light filtering through grills. For open-plan homes, use the palette inspiration in the [Eco Colours for Delhi Apartments article](/blog/delhi/eco-colours-delhi-apartments).

## Colour Palettes that Combat Pollution Fatigue

Delhi’s skyline features sandstone, concrete, and glass. To balance pollution fatigue with optimism, choose grounded neutrals and accent them with vibrant trims:

- **Metro Mist + Yamuna Teal**: A serene base with teal balcony grills that resist dust streaks. Works beautifully in Gurugram high-rises.
- **Dilli Terracotta + Qutub Cream**: Emulates heritage hues while maintaining high reflectance for heat control, inspired by the [Exterior Paints pillar](/exterior-paint).
- **Lotus Pink + Rajpath Grey**: Perfect for kids’ rooms and creative studios, as recommended in the [Eco vs Regular Health blog](/blog/delhi/eco-vs-regular-health) for wellness-focused spaces.

Integrate accent walls with smart lighting to reduce the impact of PM2.5 accumulation on perceived brightness. Ceiling Pure White keeps interiors luminous even during hazy mornings.
