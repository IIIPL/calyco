## Heavy Rain, Dense Greenery, and Heritage Timber

Assam and the broader Northeast witness some of the world’s heaviest rainfall. Towns like Cherrapunji and Mawsynram stay soaked for months, while tea estates and bamboo houses thrive amidst constant mist. Timber beams, bamboo walls, and traditional stilt homes need breathable coatings to prevent trapped moisture. Meanwhile, modern apartments in Guwahati and Imphal juggle humid summers with cool winters. Calyco’s green paint systems respond to this diversity with low-VOC, anti-fungal technology that respects local materials.

## Calyco System Recommendations

1. **Breathable Aura Matte Interiors**: Keeps living rooms fresh by allowing moisture to escape. Link the palette with ideas from the [Eco-Friendly pillar](/eco-friendly-paint).
2. **HydroShield Exterior Primer**: Seals porous bamboo and timber surfaces without blocking breathability, a technique mirrored in the [Kerala monsoon guide](/regions/exterior-eco-paints-kerala-monsoon).
3. **EcoFlex Topcoat**: Elastomeric film that flexes with wooden expansion and contraction. It resists algae growth common in valley regions.
4. **SilverShield Additive**: Mitigates mould in shaded verandahs, aligning with the health focus detailed in the [Interior Paints pillar](/interior-paint).
5. **Calyco Tools Moisture Logger**: Monitor humidity readings and schedule repaint cycles, integrating costs in ₹ for household planning.

## Palette & Cultural Harmony

- **Tea Estate Green + Misty White**: Celebrates tea gardens while keeping exteriors cool.
- **Bamboo Beige + Brahmaputra Blue**: Perfect for stilt houses and riverside resorts, referencing inspiration from the [Beach Villa Palettes blog](/blog/goa/beach-villa-palettes-eco) to blend nature with luxury.
- **Festival Ochre + Weaves Grey**: Mirrors indigenous textiles and is highlighted in the [Eco Colours for Delhi Apartments blog](/blog/delhi/eco-colours-delhi-apartments) for cross-regional styling.

Inside, use feature walls with locally inspired motifs. Calyco Aura Matte ensures artisans can paint murals without fumes, supporting cultural expression.

## Maintenance Guidance

- **Seasonal Checks**: Before the monsoon, inspect joints, window frames, and stilts. Record observations via [Calyco Tools](/tools) for reminders.
- **Gentle Cleaning**: Use soft brushes and mild soap to remove algae quarterly. Techniques align with the [Prevent Damp Walls in Kerala blog](/blog/kerala/prevent-damp-walls-eco).
- **Ventilation Synchrony**: Pair paints with proper airflow strategies to avoid condensation. See the wellness tips in the [Eco vs Regular Health blog](/blog/delhi/eco-vs-regular-health).
- **Community Coordination**: Tea estate managers can share project dashboards through [Calyco Tools](/tools), keeping compliance transparent across worker housing clusters.
