  "mastering-monochromatic-schemes": [
    "The 60-30-10 rule breakdown was exactly what I needed! I've been struggling with my bedroom redesign, and the idea of using three distinct values of the same hue makes so much sense now. The texture layering tips are gold.",
    "This is such a sophisticated approach to color. I love how you explained that monochromatic doesn't mean boring - the velvet sofa and chunky knit throw combination sounds amazing. Definitely trying this in my living room!",
    "The psychology section really resonated with me. I work from home and my grey office has been so calming. The tip about avoiding 'boring beige' by varying lightness is something I wish I'd known before painting!"
  ],
  "choosing-right-primer": [
    "Finally, someone explains the difference between water-based and solvent-based primers in plain English! The decision matrix table is incredibly helpful. I'm bookmarking this for my upcoming exterior project.",
    "The tinted primer strategy is brilliant! I had no idea you could grey-base a primer to help dark colors achieve opacity faster. This will save me so much money on my navy accent wall.",
    "As a DIY enthusiast, I appreciate the technical depth here. The stain-blocking section answered all my questions about dealing with water damage in my bathroom. Thank you, Dr. Menon!"
  ],
  "protecting-interior-woodwork": [
    "The PU vs Melamine comparison table is exactly what I was looking for! I'm refinishing my dining table and now I know PU is worth the investment for the boiling water resistance.",
    "I had no idea about the spray vs brush application difference. The 'factory finish' tips are professional-grade advice. My carpenter will love this article!",
    "The yellowing comparison sealed the deal for me - I'm going with Acrylic PU for my white oak cabinets. Great technical writing, Arjun!"
  ],
  "decoding-paint-jargon": [
    "This cleared up years of confusion! I never understood why my contractor kept asking about 'sheen' - now I know it's about durability, not just looks. The reflectivity percentages are super helpful.",
    "The 'mixing sheens for design effect' tip is genius! Same color, different sheens for a subtle pattern - I'm trying this immediately in my hallway.",
    "Love the honesty about semi-gloss highlighting every defect. Saved me from a costly mistake on my imperfect walls!"
  ],
  "choosing-perfect-accent-wall": [
    "The focal point principle is so obvious once you explain it, but I would have definitely painted the window wall! The 4-5 shades darker rule is a game-changer.",
    "Texture as an accent - mind blown! I was only thinking about color, but wood slats or concrete effect sounds so much more sophisticated.",
    "The 60-30-10 rule adaptation makes perfect sense. I love that you emphasized repeating the accent color in pillows and decor. Great design advice!"
  ],
  "solving-common-wall-problems": [
    "The chalking diagnosis saved me! I was about to just repaint over the powder, but now I know I need to wash and use a binding primer first. Thank you!",
    "The feather sanding tip for peeling paint is exactly what I needed. My contractor didn't explain this, and now I understand why the edges need to be smooth.",
    "Blistering from painting in hot sunlight - this explains everything! I made this exact mistake last summer. The 30°C temperature limit is noted."
  ],
  "warm-neutrals-winter-palette": [
    "Taupe is the bridge between gray and brown - this description finally helped me understand why my grey walls clash with my teak furniture! Switching to warm neutrals ASAP.",
    "The lighting temperature tip (2700K-3000K) is crucial! I had cool daylight bulbs and my beige walls looked terrible. Changed the bulbs and it's perfect now.",
    "Greige is my new favorite word! The idea of mixing grey and beige to work with both cool and warm decor is brilliant."
  ],
  "wood-stains-vs-paints": [
    "The fundamental difference explanation is so clear - stain penetrates, paint covers. I was about to stain over old paint on my door. Disaster averted!",
    "Love the honesty about when to use each. My pine cabinets are low quality, so paint makes sense. But I'll definitely stain my new teak dining table.",
    "The prep work section is invaluable. I didn't realize you can't stain over varnish - you have to strip completely. Thanks for the detailed guide!"
  ],
  "role-damp-guard-primers": [
    "The positive vs negative hydrostatic pressure explanation is fascinating! I finally understand why my ground floor walls keep getting damp patches.",
    "The 5-step application protocol is exactly what I needed. I didn't know you have to apply diluted first for penetration, then undiluted for the film.",
    "The moisture meter reading tip (20% threshold) is professional-level advice. I'm getting one before my next monsoon prep!"
  ],
  "beginners-guide-color-palette": [
    "Starting with an object you already love is genius! I used my favorite rug to pick my three colors and the room looks so cohesive now.",

  ],
  "ultimate-guide-exterior-prep": [
    "The 80/20 rule is so true! I skipped prep last time and the paint failed in 18 months. This time I'm doing it right with pressure washing and primer.",
    "The 24-48 hour drying time after pressure washing is critical info. I would have painted the next day and gotten blisters for sure.",
    "The fungicidal wash for algae is exactly what I need for my monsoon-facing wall. Thank you for the comprehensive guide!"
  ],
  "maximizing-space-light-colors": [
    "The warm vs cool color psychology (advance vs recede) is mind-blowing! My small bedroom needs cool blues to push the walls back visually.",
    "Painting trim the same color as walls to eliminate visual boundaries - I never would have thought of this! Trying it in my tiny bathroom.",
    "The ceiling strategy (one shade lighter than walls) is perfect for my low-ceiling apartment. High-gloss to reflect light is brilliant!"
  ],
  "vertical-gardens-living-walls": [
    "This is such a timely article! Living in a metro city, I've always wanted a vertical garden but was terrified of water damage. The comparison of treating the wall 'like a shower cubicle' really clicked for me. I wouldn't have thought about the anti-root barrier otherwise. Thanks for the clear technical advice, Rohan!",
    "The waterproofing layers breakdown is incredibly detailed! I'm a landscape architect and even I learned something new about the geotextile fabric placement. The Calyco Aqua Shield recommendation is noted.",
    "Finally, someone addresses the drainage system properly! The 2-3 degree slope for water runoff is the kind of specific detail that makes the difference between success and failure. Sharing this with my building society!"
  ],
  "eco-friendly-paint-benefits": [

    "The carbon footprint reduction stats are impressive. As someone trying to make sustainable choices, this article validated my decision to go green with paint."
  ],
  "repair-cracks-holes-internal-walls": [
    "The hairline vs structural crack distinction is so important! I was about to just fill everything with putty, but now I know when to call a structural engineer.",
    "The V-groove technique for better filler adhesion is a pro tip! My previous repairs kept falling out because I didn't know this.",
    "The Calyco Crack Seal recommendation for no-sanding repairs is exactly what I need for my quick fixes. Great practical advice!"
  ],
  "rattan-and-cane-revival": [
    "The cleaning protocol (mild soap + soft brush) saved my grandmother's cane chair! I was about to use harsh chemicals. The re-oiling tip brought back the natural sheen beautifully.",
    "I never knew you could paint rattan! The chalk paint recommendation for a modern look is inspiring. My old cane furniture is getting a makeover this weekend.",
    "The humidity control advice (40-60%) explains why my rattan started cracking. I'm getting a humidifier for the room. Thank you for the detailed care guide!"
