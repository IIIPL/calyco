      <h2>Commitment</h2>
      <p>
        CALYCO Paints Private Limited (“CALYCO”) designs, manufactures, and sells coatings with a clear priority:
        durable performance with lower environmental impact. We focus on water-based, low-VOC systems, efficient
        manufacturing, responsible sourcing, and end-of-life considerations.
      </p>

      <h2>Product Design & Formulation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Low-VOC, water-based chemistries are prioritized across interior and multi-surface lines.</li>
        <li>Solvent-borne products are limited to use-cases where performance demands it; we work to reduce solvent load and emissions.</li>
        <li>Additive and pigment choices avoid restricted substances and comply with applicable Indian regulations.</li>
        <li>Durability first: higher hiding power, scrub resistance, UV stability, and adhesion reduce repaints and material use over time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Manufacturing Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Standard operating procedures minimize raw-material loss and rework.</li>
        <li>Closed-loop handling where feasible and controlled cleanup to limit wastewater and fugitive emissions.</li>
        <li>Preventive maintenance and calibrated dosing to reduce energy and batch variance.</li>
        <li>Segregated storage for chemicals; spill prevention and immediate containment protocols.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Packaging & Materials</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary packs use recyclable HDPE pails and metal cans where applicable; secondary packs use recyclable corrugate.</li>
        <li>Clear labeling for safe use, storage, and disposal to support responsible end-of-life handling.</li>
        <li>Ongoing packaging weight and material reduction reviews without compromising product integrity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Logistics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Route planning and consolidation to cut transport emissions and damage risk.</li>
        <li>Pallet and shipper optimization to improve cube utilization.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Use Phase Guidance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Surface prep, correct spread rates, and recoat windows are documented to avoid over-application and waste.</li>
        <li>Low-odor interior systems support occupied-space application when used with adequate ventilation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Waste Management</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In-plant segregation of process waste, containers, and general scrap for compliant disposal or recycling.</li>
        <li>Customers are advised to allow leftover paint to dry before disposing per local rules or to reuse on compatible surfaces.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Compliance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Operations and products comply with applicable Indian environmental, chemical, and safety regulations.</li>
        <li>Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and Technical Data Sheets (TDS) are maintained for all products and updated as needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Supplier Expectations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Approved-vendor program with material specifications, COA verification, and prohibition of restricted substances.</li>
        <li>Preference for suppliers demonstrating consistent quality and responsible practices.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Training & Awareness</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Role-based training for production, QC, warehousing, and field teams on safe handling and spill response.</li>
        <li>Customer education on correct application and cleanup to reduce environmental load.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Periodic reviews of VOC levels, batch variance, energy use, packaging intensity, and customer complaints.</li>
        <li>Targeted projects to improve coverage per litre, extend coating life, and reduce waste per unit shipped.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
        Questions about CALYCO’s environmental practices can be submitted via the Contact page on our website. Provide the
        product name and Batch ID when the query relates to a specific coating.
